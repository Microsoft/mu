# Usage Docs

This section of the docs will contain usage information for a developer using Project Mu.  Details on compiling or testing code, gathering performance data, debug logs, or using features of the code modules will be documented here.  

This should be auto generated from markdown files scattered throughout the Project Mu code tree.  

## Details Coming Soon!

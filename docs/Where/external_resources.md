## [UEFI Industry Organization](http://www.uefi.org)

UEFI is the industry standards body that develops and distributes the UEFI, PI, and ACPI specifications.  These specifications govern the firmware interfaces between OS, OEM/Device Manufacturer, and Silicon partner. This is a great site to download the industry specifications and if you are a member you can join working groups for future specifications.  

## [TianoCore Project](https://www.tianocore.org)

Tianocore is an existing open source project. Their EDK2 repository is the basis for many/most UEFI implementations used on products today.  It provides UEFI spec compliant code modules, supports industry standard hardware, and a multi-platform build environment.  This is a great site to download specifications for the different file types and build process.  It also has links to repositories that Project Mu tracks as "upstreams".

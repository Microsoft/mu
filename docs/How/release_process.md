# Overview

In the interest of maintaining a close, well-defined relationship with the upstream project, TianoCore, the primary branch of Project Mu is periodically deprecated and all Mu-related changes are rebased on a selected commit of TianoCore. This keeps Project Mu up to date with TianoCore while highlighting all Project Mu differences in the most recent commits and encouraging the reverse integration of all universal changes/fixes back into TianoCore.

In general, the life-cycle of a branch looks like:

```
Stable Branch -> Rebase -> Build and Boot Fixes -> Active Development -> Stabilization -> Stable Branch
```

## Upstream Integration Phase

At this time, we are targeting upstream integrations for roughly once a quarter. Prior to an integration, the status dashboard (not yet created) will be updated with the target date of completion and the target TianoCore commit.

## Active Development Phase

And more.

### Public Contribution/Commentary

### Upstream Cherry-Picks

## Stabilization Phase

And more.

## Lifetime of a Single Integration

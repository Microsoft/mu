## Issue Tracker Usage

https://github.com/Microsoft/mu/issues

### General feedback and discussions?

Please start a discussion on the issue tracker.

### Bugs and feature requests?

For non-security related bugs please log a new issue on the [Project Mu repo issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu/issues). The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem. Providing a code snippet or sample driver that exposes the issue with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.  

### Reporting security issues and bugs

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)  secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).

## Contributions of Documentation and/or Code

### Pull Requests

If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests . Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide

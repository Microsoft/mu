# Requirements for contributing Source Code

## Basics

1. Make sure it follows the package, repo, and codebase rules
2. Make sure it builds
3. Write a unit test for it.  Test positive cases as well as negative cases.
4. Make sure it has docs.  Even a minimal readme.md will get collected and added to the docs.
5. Make sure it has only valid characters encoded (often copy paste from Microsoft Word docs or the internet will lead to invalid characters)
6. If it is a small change/tweak to existing code that originates outside of Project Mu please mark it with //MU_CHANGE

## Uefi Package

## UEFI Components

1. All new modules must be listed in their containing package DSC in the components section
2. All modules must follow the dependency rules of their containing package
3. All modules within common layers should avoid silicon or architecture dependencies.
    * Use existing libraries and functionality when possible
    * Build out minimal required abstraction to allow other silicon or architectures to leverage common capabilities

## Public Header files

1. Don't include other header files
2. Don't mix public and private information in the same header file
    * Implementation details should be contained to the instance
3. Use "doxygen" style function header comments to clearly specify parameters and return results.
4. Use a guidgen tool to define any guids
5. For libraries:
    * Library class should be listed in Package DEC file
    * A NULL instance must be created that allows compiling and linking with minimal dependencies.

## Library Instance

1. The supported module types in the INFs must be accurate.
    ``` inf
    LIBRARY_CLASS: <Library Class Name>|<Module types supported by this instance>
    ```
2. Use STATIC on each non-public function and non-public global to avoid conflicts with other modules.
3. Use EFIAPI on all public library class functions.

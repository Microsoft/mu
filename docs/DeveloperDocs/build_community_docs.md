# Building Community Docs

!!! info
    Today this process has been validated for use on Windows 10. This setup process is expected to roughly the same on other operating systems
    and none of the actual documentation source or tools should have any OS dependency.

## Get the docs

First you need to clone the project mu docs repo.
  `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/mu.git`

## Install required tools

1. Install python (Current suggeted version is 3.7.x).  Current min requirement is python 3.4+.  Checkout python.org for directions.
2. Install pip.  Generally this is done when installing python but can also be done as its own process.  Details here https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip
3. Update pip. `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
4. Install dependencies.

``` cmd
    pip install mkdocs
    pip install mkdocs-material
    pip install mkdocs-macros-plugin
    pip install pymdown-extensions
```

## Build the docs

1. naviage to root of repository (should see a docs folder, the mkdocs.yml file, and a few other things)
2. open command window
3. run `mkdocs build -s -v`
4. should complete with no errors


## Locally serve the docs

One great feature of mkdocs is how easy it is to locally serve the docs to validate your changes.

1. `mkdocs serve`
2. navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000 in web browser

## Conventions and lessons learned

Please update this list as you learn more.

1. filenames should all be lowercase.  
2. filenames should use "_" to separate words and should not have spaces.  
3. all links to pages are case sensitive (when published to github the server is case sensitive)
4. use a code editor like vscode for markdown.  It has linting support and will identify issues prior to build.

## Advanced doc features

We do turn on a few advanced/extension features.  Please use these carefully as they may break compatibility if the publishing engine is changed.  Checkout the [sample syntax / test page](doc_sample_test.md) for syntax and information.

# Project Mu
This repository documents Project Mu.  

Project Mu is a modular adaptation of TianoCore's edk2 tuned for building modern devices using a scalable, maintainable, and reusable pattern. The two goals of Project Mu are to share our active code tree to both solicit feedback and entice partners to collaborate and to promote, evangelize, and support an industry shift to a more collaborative environment so we all can build and maintain products with lower costs and higher quality.
